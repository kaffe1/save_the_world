## Assessment of Our Team's Way of Working based on the Essence Framework:

Our team’s way of working is currently in the Foundation Established state.

At the start of the project, we agreed on basic principles and constraints, such as using GitHub with linked issues, a Kanban-style board for tracking work, and Discord for communication. 
We selected and set up the key tools and practices needed to begin development, including a shared repository, basic task management, and testing tools, which allowed work to start quickly within the very short project duration.

However, while these practices and tools are available and partially used, they are not yet applied consistently across the whole team. 
Differences in experience, working speed, and availability, combined with limited coordination due to time pressure, meant that some practices were applied informally or only by parts of the team.

As a result, communication about time commitment and task progress was sometimes unclear, leading to delays and last-minute work before the presentation.
